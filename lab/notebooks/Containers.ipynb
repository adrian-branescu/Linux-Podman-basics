    "# Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional resources, read after finishing the course if you want more details:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __[Containers explained by google](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-containers#:~:text=Containers%20are%20packages%20of%20software,on%20a%20developer's%20personal%20laptop.)__\n",
    "2. __[Podman vs. Docker](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/podman-vs-docker)__\n",
    "3. __[Optimizing the size of images](https://devopscube.com/reduce-docker-image-size/)__\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are they?\n",
    "Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developerâ€™s personal laptop. You only need to correctly setup a container manager such as Docker or Podman.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we use them?\n",
    "The most important benefits of containers are:\n",
    "+ **Separation of responsibility** - Developers focus on application logic and dependencies while IT operations engineers focus on deployment instead of managing software versions and configurations.\n",
    "+ **Workload portability** - They can run everywhere (on most operating systems; on virtual machines or physical servers; on your personal computer or a data center).\n",
    "+ **Application isolation** - Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage and network resources at the operating system level, providing a view of the OS logically isolated from other containers. Communication between containers needs to be explicitly configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Containers vs. Virtual Machines\n",
    "Virtual machines can do many of the same things, but containers are faster and more lightweight. Containers virtualize at the operating system level while VMs virtualize at the hardware level. This means that containers share the kernel of the host operating system, use a lot less memory and are faster than VMs. Because of this a container whose image is based on the Linux kernel can only run on Linux (or Windows with the subsystem for Linux enabled).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Podman vs. Docker\n",
    "For this tutorial we'll use docker but the industry is moving away from it in favor of podman. Podman was built to seamlessly replace Docker so its commands are mostly the same. The main differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Architecture** - Docker has a client-server architecture. The client is the CLI app (the commands you run) and it communicates with the server (the docker daemon) through a REST API. The containers are thus children of the daemon process. Podman is decentralized in the sense that every time you run a new container it doesn't have to go through a single point of failure (the daemon) and it creates a new podman process which forks into the container child process.\n",
    "2. **Root Privileges** - By default Docker requires root privileges to communicate with the daemon and the process of making it run rootless is tedious. Podman is rootless by design.\n",
    "3. **Security** - While Docker is considered to be a secure tool when users apply the security best practices for it, podman is considered by most to be more secure.\n",
    "4. **Other Tools** - Only docker supports docker swarm, but podman users can use Nomad for example. Docker compose is supported by both of them as of podman version 3.0."

    "### Images and Registries\n",
    "What we did here was run a docker image called \"hello-world\". An image is pre-built environment that starts from a base operating system (for example, ubuntu 18.04) on which have been installed all dependencies an app needs. One way to think about images is through the lens of object oriented programming. An <span style=\"color:#00cc00\">**image**</span> can be thought of as a <span style=\"color:#00cc00\">**class**</span> and the <span style=\"color:#ff66ff\">**instances**</span> of that class are the <span style=\"color:#ff66ff\">**containers**</span>. This \"hello-world\" image was not on your computer when you installed Docker.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally\n",
    "latest: Pulling from library/hello-world\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hence why it's telling you it cannot find it and that it's trying to pull (download) it from the **registry**. A **registry** hosts and serves to clients whatever images they need. The default registry with docker is ___[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)___ where you can upload your own images for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Docker Hub as a GitHub for container images. However, on GitHub you usually find only application source code, while the container image usually contains the compiled application along with the environment necessary for running it (base operating system, configuration files, libraries, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Steps\n",
    "The \"hello-world\" container has outputed a message detailing what steps were followed in running it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    " 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n",
    " 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub.\n",
    "    (amd64)\n",
    " 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\n",
    "    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\n",
    " 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\n",
    "    to your terminal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed, docker uses a client-server architecture and the daemon does the actual work of downloading the image and running the container (spawning a new process based on the image). The client only transmits the command and prints the output to the terminal."

    "\n",
    "A Dockerfile is a configuration file from which we can create a container image. Each instruction creates a new layer which is an image in itself which can be cached to save time if you need to rebuild later. A layer stores changes compared to the layer it was based on.
